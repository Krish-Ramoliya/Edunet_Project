# Employee Attrition Prediction

The "Employee Attrition Prediction" project focuses on predicting employee turnover using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost, this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurately predicting employee attrition, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to retain talent.

## Project Overview

The "Employee Attrition Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can predict whether an employee will leave the company based on various features such as job satisfaction, years at the company, work-life balance, and more. Employee attrition is a significant problem for companies like IBM, leading to increased recruitment and training costs, loss of knowledge, and decreased team morale. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project offers a powerful tool for identifying at-risk employees and taking action to reduce turnover.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Processing:** The project utilizes IBM's employee attrition dataset, which contains various employee features such as age, job role, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and more. Using Pandas, the data is processed and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
  
- **Data Visualization:** The project employs data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visualizations such as bar charts, correlation heatmaps, and box plots. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between features and employee attrition.

- **Train-Test Split:** To evaluate the performance of the classification model, the project uses the train-test split technique. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data. This enables an accurate assessment of the model's predictive capabilities.

- **Classification Model using XGBoost:** The project utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, a popular gradient boosting framework, to build the classification model. XGBoost is known for its ability to handle complex relationships between features and achieve high predictive accuracy. The Scikit-learn library provides an implementation of XGBoost that is utilized in this project.

- **Model Evaluation:** The project assesses the performance of the classification model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated to evaluate the model’s performance on the testing set.
